Simple Enchant Transfer
=======

This is a lightweight Neoforge Mod that allows you to take out **individual enchantments** from your items, and convert them back into an *Enchanted Book*.

Found a Golden Pickaxe with Efficiency III? Now you can transfer that enchantment to a another tool.

It can be downloaded on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-enchant-transfer) for Minecraft 1.21.1




### How to Use
While Sneaking, Right Click on a Grindstone while having your Enchanted Item in your main hand, and at least one Book in your off-hand. It costs 3 XP levels to do this.

### Curses

Currently, the mod won't take out curses from the equipment, but it will still take out the enchantments from it. The functionality to take out curses is already there and will be an option in future versions.
